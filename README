Extra double super alpha version
of the ULTRA game
*name subject to change*

TODO:

1) Write window manager code for:
	-Windows
	-Linux
	-> Decided to use SDL, since it powers many popular indie games 
	(Amnesia, FTL, Don't Starve, and Portal)
	For windowing, threads, audio, network.
	Gives me a more portable way of cross platform implementation, 
	instead of having to write audio handling from scratch.
2) Make simple opengl implementation of sidescrolling schmup.
	-Physics
	-Mechanics
	-Texturing
