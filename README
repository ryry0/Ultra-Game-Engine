of the ULTRA game
*name subject to change*

To compile on windows:

Download the SDL 2.0.1 development libraries for MINGW/VISC++ at
http://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php

If using Code::Blocks:
Copy the folder to C: (that's the only way I know how to make it work)
Go Project -> Properties... -> Project's Build Options ... ->
	Search Directories -> Compiler
	Add your path, e. g.: 
	C:\SDL..\..\i686-w64-mingw32\include

	Then go to Linker and add
	C:\SDL..\..\i686-w64-mingw32\lib

Go to Linker settings tab and add:
	-lmingw32 -lSDL2main -lSDL2

Copy C:\SDL..\..\i686-w64-mingw32\bin\SDL2.dll to the executable directory:
	bin

TODO:
1) Write window manager code for:
	-Windows
	-Linux
	-> Decided to use SDL, since it powers many popular indie games 
	(Amnesia, FTL, Don't Starve, and Portal)
	For windowing, threads, audio, network.
	Gives me a more portable way of cross platform implementation, 
	instead of having to write audio handling from scratch.
2) Make simple opengl implementation of sidescrolling schmup.
	-Physics
	-Mechanics
	-Texturing
